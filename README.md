 SET UP AND INSTALL MYSQL WORKBENCH (FOR WINDOWS)

 > **DESCRIPTION**
 {

    MySQL is a publicly accessible Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query language (SQL) to interact with databases. MySQL stores data in the form of tables that can be modified using Structured Query Language. Its adaptability with different computing systems like Windows, Linux, macOS, and Ubuntu has made it an easy-going RDBMS software option.

    MySQL Workbench is a unified software used to add functionality and ease to SQL development work. MySQL Workbench provides data modeling, SQL development, and various administration tools for configuration. It also offers a graphical interface to work with the databases in a structured way.
